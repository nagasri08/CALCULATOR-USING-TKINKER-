This code creates a simple calculator using the Tkinter library in Python.
The global variable `calculation` is used to store the current arithmetic expression. 
The function `Add_to_calculation` appends a given symbol (number or operator) to `calculation` and updates the display. 
`evaluate_calculation` evaluates the expression in `calculation` using `eval()` and handles errors by clearing the display and showing "Error". 
The `clear_field` function resets `calculation` and clears the display. 
The Tkinter GUI consists of buttons for digits (0-9), basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, clear, and equals, laid out in a grid within the main application window.
The result of operations is displayed in a text widget at the top.
